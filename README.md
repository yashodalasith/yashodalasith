-👋 Hi, I'm @yashodalasith!

👀 I'm interested in leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and exploring the endless possibilities of software development.

🌱 I'm currently learning new programming languages, honing my skills in Information Technology, and diving deeper into the world of open-source contributions.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on exciting projects that push the boundaries of innovation and make a positive impact on society.

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me swimming laps in the pool or strategizing my next move on the chessboard!
